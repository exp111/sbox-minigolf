## Prefabs



## Entities

These should be in the prefabs for you already, but a quick rundown of the entities required in maps:

* `minigolf_hole_spawn` - a point entity where the ball spawns on the hole, the hole name and par
* `minigolf_hole_goal` - a brush entity that triggers goal on a hole
* `minigolf_hole_bounds` - a brush entity that contains the bounds

Other entities:

* `minigolf_wall` - walls are reflected, you should make these nodraw and use world geo blah blah

* `simple_rotating` - rotating lol
